        <Anime class="sectionSubtag text-small">1:  Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and
            share.<br>
            People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared
            experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and
            what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join,
            and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features,
            offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience
            Pet's Food, based on things you and others do on and off Pet's Food shop.<br><br>
            2: Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.<br>
            We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to
            make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need
            help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our
            Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information
            we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure.<br><br>
            3: Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.<br>
            Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service.
            A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us
            personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global
            community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power
            to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us
            ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.<br><br>
            4:  Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.
            We use data from Pet's Food shop, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers,
            and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to
            make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Pet's Food shop.<br><br>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Permissions You Give to Us.</h2><br><br>
            As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
            We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.<br>
            Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that
            you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever
            you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the
            Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like
            photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royaltyfree, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly
            perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy
            and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can
            delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use
            information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy.<br><br>
            Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions
            with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.
            You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such
            as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other
            sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Pet's Food shop Products, without any
            compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that
            has paid us to display its ads on Pet's Food shop.<br><br> As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts,
            actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have
            permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings.
            You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.<br><br><br>
            <h2>Additional Rights We Retain</h2><br><br>
            If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is
            appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates
            another user).<br><br></p>

            <h2>Our Agreement.</h2><br><br>
            • If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made
            available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use
            payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If
            any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.<br><br>
            • If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.<br>
            • Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If
            we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.<br><br>
            • We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.<br><br>
            Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.
            This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
            You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
            Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our
            ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
            Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.<br><br>
            Our Service is provided “as is,” and we can’t guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work
            perfectly all the time.<h3> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
            WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</h3><br><br>
            We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or
            your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or
            objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other
            people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.<br><br>
            Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called “liability”) is limited as
            much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can’t know what all the
            possible impacts might be. You agree that we won’t be responsible (“liable”) for any lost profits,
            revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or
            incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible.
            This includes when we delete your content, information, or account.
